All from the lovely folks at [bargainhardware.co.uk](https://bargainhardware.co.uk), for the princely sum of Â£765.59. It was ordered on a Monday morning, and arrived early on Wednesday, in the midst of the 2020 pandemic, which is damn good going!

### That's a weird name
I have a habit of naming things after songs by [The Presidents of the United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America_(band))  (see also "Tiny Explosions"), and it seems quite apt really. It's also [a pretty cool song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIWoVBeYkPw).
